<h1>100 Days of Coding: Day 2.</h1>
<h2>Counting app.</h2>
<div>
  This app is just a simple counting application meant to show an understanding of connecting JS to HTML elements and the core, basic uses of functions in relation. It also has minor CSS that will eventually be added upon at a later time.
  The main focus of this is to confirm skills from the previous day, as well as begin to understand the uses of GIT with multiple repositories, pulling, and commands.
