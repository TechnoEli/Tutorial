<h1>100 days of coding; Day 3</h1>
<div>
  Continuing todays work, I'm now moved on to the concept of Switches. Switches are an alternative for using a lot of if else statements. In my code here, i create a brief, movie 
  questioning webpage. Using four radio buttons and four onclick methods, I created a switch case in each onclick to act as if else statements and give reactive information based on the 
  selected option.
