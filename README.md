<h1>100 Days of code part 1: Studying the basics.</h1>
<div>
  This is nothing but me accessing and starting to relearn, refresh, and recode small time apps using vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Eventually, I will create applications with React, however that will be far in the future. With the final goal of being able to look back and see how much I've come over time. 
</div>
<h2>How does this work?</h2>
<div>
  Each day I will work on new fundamentals and concepts. I spend four hours of my morning and push a repository to a secondary, working branch with a README to explain what I learned that day.

<h3>What did you learn today?</h3>

  Today, 08/24/2024, I went over setting up my environment on my MacBook such as VSCode as my IDE and Git as my version control. After, I jumped into programming. Starting with basics such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Connecting files together in a HTML.</li>
    <li>Going over the core three data types; Numbers, Strings, and Booleans.</li>
    <li>Implimenting variables such as let and const to offer different relationships based on need of code.</li>
    <li>Understand the onclick event and how to store input information from a user into the computers local memory</li>
    <li>Incrimentation</li>
  </ul>
  This ends day 1 of 100 days of code. Overall, I am excited to move forward and get back on track to becoming a proper web developer and software engineer.

  After returning from vacation, I'm returning back to my full schedule of daily code with the exception of taking Wednesdays and Thursday's off for rest. Much as the break was enjoyable, I've greatly missed things. I also started this terms classes as well for my university. I have a lot to do and I don't plan on slacking anymore. Looking forward to today's lessons!
